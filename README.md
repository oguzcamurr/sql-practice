MySQL practice queries, datasets and case studies for data analytics and business problems.
 #SQL Practice by Oğuz Çamur

🗄️ This repository contains my SQL practice queries and case studies.  
I use **MySQL Workbench** on Windows to build and test queries with sample datasets.  

---

## 📂 Structure
- **basic/** → SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT  
- **intermediate/** → JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING  
- **advanced/** → Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, QUALIFY, etc.)  
- **datasets/** → CSV or sample databases (e.g. Olist, Chinook, Sakila)  
- **queries/** → Real business-style questions (top customers, monthly growth, retention)

## 🛠️ Setup
1. Install [MySQL Community Edition](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).  
2. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oguzcamurr/sql-practice.git
Run queries in MySQL Workbench:

('Mehmet', 'Izmir', 50.75);
Get All Customers

sql
Kodu kopyala
SELECT * FROM customers;
🎯 Goals
Practice SQL daily (from basics to advanced window functions)

Apply queries on real-world datasets (Kaggle, sample DBs)
