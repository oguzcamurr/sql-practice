# 🗄️ SQL Practice by Oğuz Çamur

📘 This repository documents my SQL learning journey with real datasets.  
I use **MySQL Workbench** and sample databases like **Sakila** to practice queries,  
starting from the basics and moving into advanced analytics.

- `advanced/` → Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, QUALIFY)  
- `case_studies/` → Business-style queries on real datasets  
- `tracks/` → Step-by-step learning tracks (Sakila, Chinook, etc.)
